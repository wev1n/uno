## About this project

This project is mainly for me to learn how to build a production-ready app, in this case using Next.js 14 and TypeScript. Hopefully it will also serve as a fun and functional game to play by yourself or with friends.

## Why?

The whole reason behind building this uno game is for me to learn various things about programming but also to create a fun game that i can make my friends play with me. There also might or might not be a way to cheat the game, guaranteeing an even more fun time for you as the developer, but you didn't hear that from meðŸ˜‰
